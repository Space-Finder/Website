# Space Finder Website

See explanation of project on [organisation page](https://github.com/Space-Finder/).

---

This repo contains all the code for the website portion of the Space Finder system. The website is made using Next JS and is full stack, however I also use an [external API](https://github.com/Space-Finder/API) I made using python.
